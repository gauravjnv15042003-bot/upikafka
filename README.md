1️⃣ ZooKeeper startup
Command you ran:

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Output:

INFO Reading configuration from: config/zookeeper.properties
INFO clientPortAddress is 0.0.0.0:2181
INFO Purge task is not scheduled.
✅ Explanation:
* ZooKeeper is the coordination service Kafka uses to manage brokers, topics, and leader election.
* clientPort=2181 means Kafka brokers connect to ZooKeeper at port 2181.
* Logs show ZooKeeper started successfully.

2️⃣ Kafka broker startup
Command:

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Output:

INFO connecting to zookeeper on localhost:2181
INFO starting kafka.server.KafkaServer
✅ Explanation:
* Kafka broker connects to ZooKeeper at port 2181.
* KafkaServer starts listening on default broker port 9092.
* Kafka is now ready to receive messages from producers and send to consumers.

3️⃣ Kafka Console Consumer
Command:

./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic upi-transactions --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Output:

New Transaction: 1 Amount: 1245.75
New Transaction: 2 Amount: 12.75
New Transaction: 3 Amount: 1213.75
✅ Explanation:
* You are reading messages from topic upi-transactions from the beginning.
* Each line corresponds to a transaction sent by your Spring Boot producer.
* Example:    New Transaction: 1 Amount: 1245.75
*   
    * 1 → transaction ID
    * 1245.75 → amount
This confirms Kafka is working perfectly, and messages from your UPI app are flowing through Kafka.

4️⃣ How your UPI Spring Boot project fits
Flow:
1. POST /transactions → Spring Boot saves transaction to H2 database.
2. Spring Boot Kafka producer sends the transaction to upi-transactions topic.
3. Kafka broker receives it and stores in the topic.
4. Consumers (Spring Boot @KafkaListener or console consumer) read from topic.
5. You can process it:
    * Update DB
    * Notify users
    * Print logs

Visual Flow:

[Client POST /transactions] 
       │
       ▼
[Spring Boot Controller]
       │
       ▼
[Service saves to H2 DB] 
       │
       ▼
[Kafka Producer] 
       │
       ▼
[Kafka Broker (localhost:9092)]
       │
       ├────────► [Spring Boot Consumer prints/updates]
       └────────► [Kafka Console Consumer terminal]

✅ Key points
* ZooKeeper: coordinates Kafka brokers.
* Kafka broker: stores messages in topics.
* Producer: sends messages to Kafka topic.
* Consumer: reads messages from Kafka topic.
* H2 DB: your persistent store for transactions.

If you want, I can make a diagram + fully working Spring Boot project where POST automatically prints notifications via Kafka in both console and app logs.
